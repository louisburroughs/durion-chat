// Placeholder Gradle build file for the durion-chat component.
//
// The main durion-moqui-frontend project is built using the
// root-level build.gradle. This file is provided so that the
// component can have custom build logic in the future (for
// example, additional Groovy/Java tests or tooling) without
// impacting the main build.

// Add plugins, dependencies, and tasks here only if you have
// a concrete need to build this component standalone.
